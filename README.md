#### 1. Database setup(for MYSQL)
- Open 'MySQL Workbench'.
- Connect to your server.
- Create database.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE tms_db;
```
#### 2. Open your terminal and execute these commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hemantDwivedi/tms.git
cd tms

```
Backend setup:
- Open 'task-management-system' project folder in any IDE(I personally prefer IntelliJ IDEA).
- Run the project. IntelliJ IDEA shortcut key press ```shift + f10```
- Now your backend code is running successfully.

#### 3. Frontend setup
- Open 'frontend' folder in ```vs-code```. You can find this folder in project root folder ```./task-management-system/frontend```
- In vs-code open terminal, execute this command ```npm install```.
- Now execute ```npm run dev```.
- Frontend is running on http://localhost:3000/

You can also check documentation for backend.
